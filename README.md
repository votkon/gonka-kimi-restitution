# GRC-GONKA-265: Kimi Restitution, Epochs 265–276

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Case** | `GRC-GONKA-265` - Kimi operator restitution: external attack (e265–e266) + ComputeGroupCap underpayment (e267–e276) |
| Epochs affected | 265–276 |
| Affected participants | 53 unique addresses |
| Estimated compensation | 946,509.93 GONKA |
| **Cause and evidence** | External actor sent malicious requests crashing Kimi vLLM nodes in e265–e266, causing CPoC degradation and mass nonce exclusion; the resulting N-1 weight collapse triggered ComputeGroupCap inversion every epoch through e276. Evidence: [`weight_fluctuation_analysis.md`](weight_fluctuation_analysis.md), per-epoch compensation scripts and JSON in `e265/`–`e276/`. |
| **Can it happen again?** | ComputeGroupCap: `No known repeat path` — resolved by v0.2.13 WeightScaleFactor adjustment. External vLLM attack: `Reduced risk` — the specific crash vectors (`stop_token_ids`+`min_tokens` OOM, `prompt_logprobs` OOM, JSON schema recursion bomb, Jinja injection via `chat_template_kwargs`) are patched at the devshard gateway (PRs #1170, #1171, #1180, merged May 16–18). A proxy geo-module bug (PR #1183) that made all IP-based rate-limiting ineffective during e265 was also fixed May 18. No known remaining crash path, but gateway coverage of unknown vLLM attack surface cannot be guaranteed. |
| **Mitigation / fix** | Nonce exclusion bug: fixed before e267 (version unconfirmed). ComputeGroupCap: v0.2.13 at block 4,267,300 (WeightScaleFactor for Kimi reduced to 0.78). External vLLM attack: devshard gateway patches merged May 16–18 2026 — PR #1170 (`stop_token_ids`+`min_tokens` strip, the confirmed e264/e265 attack vector), PR #1171 (`prompt_logprobs` OOM strip), PR #1180 (CVE-class defenses: schema recursion, Jinja injection, body depth pre-scan), PR #1183 (proxy geo-module bug fix — rate-limiting was non-functional during the attack). |
| **Compensation overlap** | Requires investigation — potential address overlap with separate restitution tracks not yet audited. |
| **Current decision** | GRC voted to exclude this case from proposal #4 (6 exclude, 2 include, 1 abstain). Calculations are published here for community reference if anyone chooses to bring this forward independently. |
| **Review focus** | Highest risk: e266 nonce reconstruction methodology (18 participants, 183,605 GONKA); confirm reconstructed weights match on-chain nonce commits in `poc_commits/`. Secondary: e276 partial-epoch cutoff at block 4,267,299. |

## GRC Position

**E265–E266 (external attack):** The lost rewards in epochs 265 and 266 were a direct
result of a third-party attack on Kimi vLLM nodes. Losses caused by external actors are
outside the scope of the Gonka Restitution Committee. These epochs cannot be included in
a GRC proposal.

**E267–E276 (ComputeGroupCap):** The cap breach was triggered by the attack-induced N-1
weight collapse in e266, but it was not caused solely by that event. As noted by a
committee reviewer:

> "Additionally, the GroupCap issue was not caused solely by recovery from the attack.
> It was also influenced by the significant weight imbalance between Kimi and Qwen. In
> fact, update 0.2.13 specifically reduced Kimi's weight for this reason. GroupCap was
> effectively acting as a balancing mechanism to normalize profitability between the
> models."

This context further reduces the case for GRC restitution: the cap was partly correcting
a structural imbalance, not purely an anomalous malfunction.

**GRC vote outcome:** The committee voted **against** including this case in the next
proposal.

| Vote | Count |
|------|-------|
| Include | 2 |
| Exclude | 6 |
| Abstain | 1 |

The compensation calculations in this repository were prepared and validated by two
committee reviewers. They are published here so that the community can use these findings
if anyone chooses to bring this proposal forward independently.

## Overview

This repository contains the restitution analysis for epochs 265 through 276 of the
Gonka network. Two distinct bugs caused underpayment to `moonshotai/Kimi-K2.6` operators
across these epochs:

- **Epochs 265–266**: external attack — an unknown actor sent malicious requests targeting
  Kimi vLLM nodes starting in e265 (attack payload confirmed from production logs: `stop_token_ids`
  + `min_tokens` combination that triggers a vLLM CUDA assert, crashing the engine; 16 crashes
  across 12/14 mlnodes observed on 2026-05-14), causing CPoC confirmation weight degradation,
  and escalating in e266 to crash most operators and cause mass nonce exclusion; delegation
  compensation included for e266 delegators; gateway patches merged May 16–18 (PRs #1170, #1171,
  #1180, #1183)
- **Epochs 267–276**: `ComputeGroupCap` underpayment — the e266 collapse destroyed the
  N-1 reference weight used by the cap formula, and when Kimi operators returned in e267
  with full accumulated confirmation weight the mismatch caused a severe inversion;
  the cap remained triggered every epoch until the v0.2.13 upgrade

The cap breach was resolved by the v0.2.13 upgrade at block **4,267,300** (mid-epoch 276),
which reduced Kimi's WeightScaleFactor to 0.78. Epoch 277 is the first clean epoch.

## Eligibility Criteria

**Epoch 265 (external attack — CPoC degradation):** Participants whose confirmation
weight dropped abnormally mid-epoch at block 4,103,171 due to the attack. Compensation
uses `weight / total_epoch_weight × epoch_reward − actual_rewards`.

**Epoch 266 (external attack — nonce exclusion):** The attack escalated, crashing most
Kimi operators and causing mass nonce exclusion. Participants who submitted valid Kimi
nonces but were never registered in the epoch group (or had their Kimi contribution
zeroed) are eligible. Delegation compensation is also included for participants whose
operator was excluded.

**Epochs 267–276 (ComputeGroupCap):** A participant is eligible only if they
**successfully completed the epoch** — meaning they both confirmed work
(`confirmation_weight` on-chain) AND received actual rewards. Participants who failed
the epoch for any reason are excluded: the bug caused underpayment to healthy
participants, not an obligation to pay those who didn't complete the epoch.

---

## Delegation Impact (Epoch 266)

Gonka uses a PoC delegation system where participants without direct MLNodes can
delegate their consensus weight to an operator. When an operator fails to enter the
epoch (due to the nonce bug), the chain resolves all their delegators into **ModeNone**
instead of **ModeDelegate**:

| Mode | Condition | Weight effect |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| `ModeDelegate` | Operator entered epoch | −5% transferred to operator |
| `ModeNone` | Operator did not enter | −15% deducted as penalty |

The net extra loss for a delegator whose Kimi operator was excluded is **10%** of their
original consensus weight.

## Epoch 265 — External Attack (CPoC Degradation)

All Kimi operators entered the epoch group, but CPoC confirmation weights dropped
abnormally at block **4,103,171** as a result of the external attack on Kimi vLLM nodes.
3 participants were affected.

`compensation = max(0, weight / total_epoch_weight × epoch_reward − actual_rewards)`

## Epoch 266 — External Attack (Nonce Exclusion)

The attack escalated in e266, crashing most Kimi operators' inference nodes and causing
mass exclusion from the epoch. 9 participants submitted Kimi nonces and had their commits
recorded on-chain but were never registered in the epoch group. A further 9 participants entered the epoch but with
their Kimi contribution partially zeroed out. The on-chain total epoch weight was
**335,159** — the correctly reconstructed weight from all nonce commits is **1,079,698**,
meaning ~69% of the network's true Kimi work was invisible to the reward calculation.

### Part 2: Delegation compensation (9 participants)

9 participants delegated their Kimi weight to `gonka1q5xt54...` (excluded operator).
The chain penalised them 15% (ModeNone) instead of transferring 5% (ModeDelegate) —
net extra weight loss of 10% per participant.

## Epoch 267 — ComputeGroupCap (worst epoch)

All Kimi operators entered the epoch, but the Kimi group's raw weight (**899,487**)
far exceeded the ComputeGroupCap (`0.75 × epoch 266 total weight 335,159 = 251,369`).
The e266 total weight was severely depressed by a targeted external attack on Kimi
vLLM nodes, which crashed most operators and collapsed network weight to 335k. This
destroyed the N-1 reference weight used by the cap formula for e267 — when Kimi
operators returned with full accumulated confirmation weight, the mismatch caused the
worst inversion of the entire incident (conf/weight ratio 1.75×).
