# Delegation Impact Analysis — Epoch 266

## Background

An external attack on Kimi vLLM nodes (which began in e265) escalated in epoch 266,
crashing most operators' inference nodes and causing 9 participants to be completely
excluded from the epoch group — they submitted Kimi nonces on-chain but their weight
was never registered. As a result, anyone who had delegated their Kimi consensus weight
to one of those excluded operators was also harmed indirectly via the delegation penalty
mechanism.

## How PoC Delegation Works

Participants who don't run an MLNode directly can delegate their consensus weight
to an operator (a direct epoch member) for a given model. The delegation is frozen into
a **snapshot** at block `poc_start - deploy_window` (deploy_window = 500 blocks).

For each model, the chain resolves each non-direct participant into one of four modes:

| Mode | Condition | Effect |
|------|-----------|--------|
| `DIRECT` | Participant is a member of the epoch group | No penalty, earns rewards directly |
| `DELEGATE` | Delegation points at an operator who entered the epoch | `delegation_share` (5%) transferred to operator |
| `NONE` | No delegation set, or delegation points at a non-participating operator | `no_participation_penalty` (15%) deducted |
| `REFUSE` | Explicit refusal | `refusal_penalty` (10%) deducted |

Penalties accumulate additively across all eligible models and are capped at 100%.
They are applied to the participant's consensus weight before rewards are distributed.

Kimi (`moonshotai/Kimi-K2.6`) has `penalty_start_epoch = 251`, so penalties apply
from epoch 251 onward. Epoch 266 > 251, so the Kimi penalty was active.

## What Happened in Epoch 266

Because the attack prevented 9 operators from entering the epoch, any
participant whose Kimi delegation pointed at one of those operators was forced into
**`ModeNone`** instead of `ModeDelegate`.

This caused an **extra 10% weight penalty** per affected participant:

```
Expected (ModeDelegate):  -5%  weight transferred to operator
Actual   (ModeNone):      -15% weight deducted as penalty
Extra loss:               -10% of original consensus weight
```

The 9 excluded operators and the delegators who pointed to them:

Only `gonka1q5xt54...` had active Kimi delegations pointing at it at snapshot height
4104861 (epoch 266 start − 500 blocks).

## Compensation Methodology

1. Recover each delegator's original weight before penalty:
   `original = chain_weight / (1 - 0.15)`

2. Calculate the extra weight lost vs what should have happened:
   `extra_loss = original * (0.15 - 0.05) = original * 0.10`

3. Convert weight loss to reward loss using the epoch reward pool:
   `compensation = extra_loss / total_epoch_weight * epoch_theoretical_reward`

Chain params used:
- `no_participation_penalty` = 0.15 (actual, ModeNone)
- `delegation_share` = 0.05 (expected, ModeDelegate)
- `epoch_theoretical_reward` = 284,797.19 GONKA
- `total_epoch_weight` = 335,159 (post-adjustment, as used by the chain)
